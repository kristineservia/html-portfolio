<p>Hello, I'm Kristine. Currently, I'm a Web Development student in Angela Yu's <br>
  UDEMY Web Development Bootcamp. <!--I'm also enrolled in Southern New Hampshire 
  University, working on a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with concentration 
  in Software Engineering.--></p>

<p>My background is in Visual Art and Graphic Design. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 
  Image and Design from Escuela de Artes Plasticas de Puerto Rico, and a Master of Fine 
  Arts in Fiber and Material Studies from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. </p>

<p>I'm interested in visual art, art publishing, computers, learning to make robots, and 
  learning to fly drones. I work as a Visual Artist, and soon hope to start working as a 
  Web Developer designing and building websites and applications.</p>
